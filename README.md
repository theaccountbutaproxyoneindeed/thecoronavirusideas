just about anything you do or don't think of can go here.


#### New Zeland self-isolation claims

- The resources provided by the ministry of health lack specific guidelines or ideas on how to source resources or needs created by the need to self-isolate.

- The information regarding coronavirus in public spaces could be better, for example;
coronavirus patients attending a clinic are advised to phone in advance. Will the people attending the clinic receive any information, or could the clinic, acting out of intentions other than to contain the spread of the virus, refrain from informing the people within the clinic?

Hmmmmm.

I'm no expert it appears, on anything really. back to computer science for me!
